Developed and tested with the Arduino IDE version 1.8.19 using the David Mellis ATtiny Core version 1.0.2 and the Spark Fun ATtiny85 USB programmer modified to also support the ATtiny84.

We've been testing the Mega328 processor on an Arduino Uno board (16MHz), the ATtiny85 (8 pin processor) at 16MHz internal clocking, and the ATtiny84 (14 pin processor) running at 8Mhz internal clocking.
